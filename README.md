# Known Issues
If you are running on a system (Like mine) where your AppData folder is on a drive different than your C: drive, the code will NOT work due to PATH variables (To check if this is your issue, Press Windows Key + R and type in "%appdata%Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Chrome Apps" without quotes and press enter, it will say "location not available" oe something along those lines)

Windows SmartScreen will flag the application, to fix this click more information then run anyway
